# Directory structure

## General

| Directory | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| `/routes` | Routes and controllers |
| `/views` | Templates (Pug) |
| `/lib` | Utility functions |
| `/docs` | README files |
| `/tests` | Tests for which there is no clear source file, meaning the usual convention of making a `*.test.js` file alongside the file to test doesn't apply. |
| `/build` | Scripts for compiling assets/images. All build scripts are initiated from `package.json`. |

## Data

The site does not make use of any databases. Data to populate templates is stored in JSON files.

| Directory | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| `/data` | JSON files written by hand |
| `/data/generated` | JSON files generated by build scripts |

## Static files

Everything in the `/public` directory is served as static content. Its contents
are generated completely by build scripts from the contents of `/publicSrc`.

| Directory | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| `/public` | Static files to serve from site root |
| `/publicSrc/scripts` | Frontend scripts that compile into a single JS file |
| `/publicSrc/styles` | Frontend styles (PostCSS) that compile into a single CSS file |
| `/publicSrc/copy` | Files to copy to `/public` |
| `/publicSrc/process` | Files to convert/compress before copying to `/public` |
| `/publicSrc/processUncommitted` | The same as `/publicSrc/process`, but for large images and videos that are excluded from this repository due to file size. |
